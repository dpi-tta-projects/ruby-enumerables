#
# Goal:
#   Take a randomly sampled numbers array and separate
#   the even and odd numbers into two different arrays.
#   Print both arrays â€” even numbers first, then odd numbers.
#
# Example:
#   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#   Output:
#   [2, 4, 6]
#   [1, 3, 5]
#
# Hint:
#   Use `select` to pick even numbers, and `reject` to pick the odd ones.
#

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].sample(6)
