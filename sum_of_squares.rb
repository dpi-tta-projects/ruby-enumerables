# sum_of_squares.rb
#
# Goal:
#   Write a program that takes a randomly sampled array of numbers,
#   squares each one using `map`, and then prints the sum of all the squares.
#
# Example:
#   numbers = [1, 2, 3]
#   Output:
#   14
#   # because 1² + 2² + 3² = 14
#
# Hint:
#   You can combine Enumerable methods! Try using `map` to transform the numbers,
#   and `sum` to add them up.
#

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].sample(4)
